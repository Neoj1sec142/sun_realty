# Sun Realty Database Management App:
***   
### Planning:
* Each page should be multi page diverse with redux stability. Guard bariers and conditional return statements to decide which to render. Each Model should have 3 functioning components on each page (list, create(onCLick render), loading dots) along with a functioning profile and update profile page. As far as CRUD goes we will look farther into functionality when the time draws farther.
